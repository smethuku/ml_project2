Step 1:
 Get the restore start time and sql_text from SYS.dm_exec_requests r
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(r.sql_handle) AS st
WHERE r.COMMAND = 'RESTORE DATABASE'

Step 2: filter for the database name from the sql_text and get the restore start time and sql_text

Step 3: Get the count of the Transaction Log Backups from the sql_text, we can filter and count the number of times "RESTORE LOG" is in sql_text 

Step 3: 
 In a while loop
	1. check if the database is still in restoring mode - use SMO for this
	2. Check if there are any entries in msdb.dbo.restorehistory after the restore start time
	3. Show the current restore type (it could be FULL or Transactoin Log), percentage of the restore.
			When showing the Transaction Log Percentage, you can refer to the count and the number of entries in msdb.dbo.restorehistory, to figure out which tlog is getting restored
if the database is online, exit the while loop, and report the last tlog restore datetime
