Slide 2: Agenda

	•	Current Security Model Overview
	•	Challenges with the Existing Model
	•	The Proposed New Security Model
	•	Key Benefits of the New Model
	•	Migration Plan
	•	Next Steps and Questions

Slide 3: Current Security Model Overview

	•	Direct User Mapping to Roles
	•	AD users directly assigned to SSAS database roles.
	•	Roles are manually created in the SSAS database for specific access (Read, Write, Process, Admin).
	•	User management is done at the database level.

Slide 4: Challenges with the Current Model

	•	High Maintenance:
	•	Manual user-role management leads to increased administrative effort.
	•	Direct mapping of users to roles lacks scalability.
	•	Lack of Role-Based Grouping:
	•	No centralized grouping for roles, leading to inconsistency.
	•	Onboarding Complexity:
	•	Adding a new user requires multiple steps, making it slow and prone to errors.

Slide 5: The New Security Model - Overview

	•	Standardized Role Creation in SSAS:
	•	Creation of SSAS roles for Read, Process, Write, and Admin.
	•	Active Directory Integration:
	•	AD groups created with a standardized naming convention:
businessname_databasename_cubename_read/write/process/admin.
	•	User Management via AD Groups:
	•	Existing users migrated to AD groups, future users are added to appropriate AD groups.
	•	Eliminates direct user-role mapping in SSAS.

Slide 6: Benefits of the New Model

	•	Streamlined User Management:
	•	Centralized control of user access through AD groups.
	•	Easier onboarding and offboarding with reduced admin overhead.
	•	Scalability:
	•	Simplified role management for future databases and cubes.
	•	Easy to replicate and apply the model across different business areas.
	•	Consistency and Security:
	•	Standard naming conventions for AD groups.
	•	Clear separation of duties across Read, Write, Process, and Admin roles.

Slide 7: Migration Plan

	•	Step 1: Inventory of existing users and roles in SSAS.
	•	Step 2: Creation of AD groups following the standard naming convention.
	•	Step 3: Mapping existing users to new AD groups based on current roles.
	•	Step 4: Testing of new security model with a subset of users.
	•	Step 5: Full migration of all users to AD groups.
	•	Step 6: Decommission direct user-role mapping in SSAS.

Slide 8: Next Steps

	•	Implement New Model:
	•	Begin with a pilot phase for one cube or database.
	•	Monitor and Adjust:
	•	Collect feedback and adjust the model as needed.
	•	Full Rollout:
	•	Plan for company-wide implementation once the pilot phase is successful.

Slide 9: Questions and Discussion

	•	Open the floor for questions, feedback, and concerns from the team.
